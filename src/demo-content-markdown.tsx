Welcome to the **Teacher Edition** of the _**GEODE: What will Earth look like
in 500 million years?**_ activity sequence. This interactive guide will
help you get acquainted with these activities from a student’s perspective
and also provide you with learning theory and learning objectives,
additional information on subject matter, classroom discussion points,
and tips on achieving learning goals.

# Getting Started

To begin, work through the lesson’s content page by page. The Teacher
Edition components — which you can **click** or **tap** to open and close —
will highlight additional information in several key areas:

* **Theory & Background** will provide you with the learning objectives
of the instructional model developed for this sequence of activities.

* **Teacher Tips** are instructional resources and methods that you may
find useful to help your students achieve their learning goals.

* **Discussion Points** highlight questions that may help prompt
classroom discourse with the goal of expanding students’ understanding.

* **Digging Deeper** components provide additional subject matter and
related topics that you may find helpful in furthering your students’
deeper understanding of the content.

This page is the first of a series of model and data-based case studies

### Tests of Markdown Syntax

#### 1 Text Styles

The basic, semantic, text markdown stiles area supported:

| Markdown                | Result               |
|:-----------------------:|:--------------------:|
| \`**bold**\`            |  **bold**            |
| \`_italic_\`            |  _italic_            |
| \`_**bold & italic**_\` |  _**bold & italic**_ |
| \` \`typewriter\` \`    | \`typewriter\`       |

#### 2 Bullet Lists

* This is a bullet item.
* And a second bullet item.
  * A nested bullet item.
    * A nested, nested bullet item.
  * A second nested bullet item.
  * A **third** nested bullet item.
* Finally, we finish up with - a third bullet item; and,
* a fourth bullet item.

#### 3 Numbered Lists

These work in a manner very similar to bullet lists, but use a
\`1.\`, instead of a \`*\`, to preface each list item. The \`1\` is
replaced with the correct number without the author having to count
the items.

1. This is a point.
1. This is another point.
  1. And some more stuff.
  1. And more, of course.
1. And the last one.

#### 4 Other Stuff

Other markdown facilities might also be available, but have not been tested.
Things like:

* Block quotes
* Unformated blocks (like "typewriter" but for a block of text)
* Hyphen and equal sign headers
